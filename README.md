# EPA Visualizer

üéì _HU Studienarbeit ‚Äî Moritz Lindner_

[![Gradle Build & Test](https://github.com/linde9821/epa-visualizer/actions/workflows/gradle.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/linde9821/epa-visualizer/actions/workflows/gradle.yml)

## üîç Overview

**EPA Visualizer** constructs and visualizes an **Extended Prefix Automaton (EPA)** from event logs.  
An EPA is a prefix automaton extended with partitions, where each partition represents a distinct *variant* (unique 
execution trace) observed in the event log.

EPAs provide a complete, non-abstracted representation of all observed process behavior ‚Äî preserving full trace 
information while capturing shared prefixes in a compact graphical form.  
This enables interactive and animated visualization of process behavior and variation, with a primary focus on exploring 
variants within the process.

The tool helps users understand process complexity and behavior through:
- variant-based views of the process
- structural insights into common prefixes and branching points
- flexible filtering options to explore and manage large or deep EPAs 
- statistics and animations of events flowing through an EPA

Key capabilities include advanced filtering, playback of process cases, and statistical summaries. The tool supports 
event logs in `.xes` and `.xes.gz` formats.

## üìù Planned Features and Known Issues

### Planned Features / Ideas

#### Layouts

- **New Layout:** *Weighted Direct Angular Placement*  
  ‚Üí Take the number of nodes in a node's subtree into account when calculating the arc assigned to each subtree

- **New Layout:** *Time-Radius-Semantic*  
  ‚Üí Make the depth (radius) of a nodes placement dependent on a time component ‚Äî e.g., maybe also in animation based on
  cycle time in a time window

- **New Layout:** *Probability Semantic*  
  ‚Üí Add a value representing the probability of each partition and visualize it

#### Filters

- **New Filter:** *Chain Pruning*  
  ‚Üí Many long "chains" exist in the EPA (subgraphs with only one incoming edge and one outgoing edge).  
  These chains could be collapsed into a single new state for more compact visualization.

- **New Filter:** *Depth Interval*  
  ‚Üí Filter the visualization to only show nodes within a given radius (depth) interval.

- **New Filter:** *Normalized Entropy Partition Filter*  
  ‚Üí Based on normalized entropy measures (see Augusto, Mendling, Vidgof, & Wurm (2022) ‚Äî Extended Prefix Automata).

- **New Filter:** *Normalized Entropy Variant Filter*  
  ‚Üí Based on normalized entropy measures (see Augusto, Mendling, Vidgof, & Wurm (2022) ‚Äî Extended Prefix Automata).

#### Visualization

- **State Properties**  
  ‚Üí States could have visual properties (color, size, etc.) mapped to various attributes ‚Äî also changing dynamically during animation.
  (Differentiate edge thickness or color based on event count, the ideas are endless)

- **Case Properties**  
  ‚Üí Each case in the animation could display various properties, with the ability to track a selected case during the animation.

- **Event Properties**  
  ‚Üí Each event in the animation could display various properties (visualized per event instance).

#### UI

- Improve observability during loading  
  ‚Üí Currently the UI shows an indeterminate progress bar. This could be changed to display actual progress  
  (both the construction and visitor processes can be extended/utilized to track "x out of total elements processed").

- More "desktop look & feel"  
  ‚Üí Switching to [JetBrains Jewel](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/tree/master/platform/jewel) components could provide a more native desktop style.

#### Others

- The tree layout algorithm is fairly general and could be provided as a standalone library for others to use.

- The `epa` module could be packaged and provided as a separate library ‚Äî reusable in other projects.

### Known Bugs

- Component state (Filter, Animation, etc.) is lost on recomposition  
  ‚Üí _TODO: fix_

- Slider in Animation UI for full log animation cannot be moved while animation is running  
  ‚Üí _TODO: fix_

- View Model usage state bugs (e.g., stopping the animation results in no events being drawn for full log animation)  
  ‚Üí _TODO: fix_

### Potential Improvements

- Pre-render the tree layout to a texture and render the texture instead of the entire tree on every frame  
  _(similar to how labels are currently rendered in the tree); rerender only when necessary (e.g., after filtering)_

- Core data structures in EPA construction are optimized, but some data structures and algorithms in animation/statistics 
  and others are not optimal ‚Äî can be improved for better performance

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

The project consists of two modules:

1. **`epa`** ‚Äî core logic for EPA construction, layout generation, visitors for automation, statistics, etc.
2. **`ui`** ‚Äî desktop application (Kotlin Compose Desktop), built on top of the `epa` module.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- JDK **21+**
- Kotlin **2.1.20+**
- Gradle (or use the included Gradle wrapper)

### Run the App

```bash
./gradlew run
```

### Custom `EventLogMapper`

To support additional event log formats, you can implement a custom EventLogMapper and plug it into the application.
Out-of-the-box, the project provides mappers for logs included in the resources folder.

### Writing code

The project is designed for easy extension.
In most cases, using the `AutomataVisitor` interface is sufficient for adding new functionality ‚Äî it provides complete 
and correct traversal (depth-first or breadth-first) of the EPA.
Core features such as filtering, animation, and statistics are already implemented using this pattern ‚Äî making it a 
natural extension point for new features or experiments.

## üìö Background
This software is part of a university Studienarbeit (pre-master thesis project) exploring new visualization techniques 
for process mining.

Based on concepts from (but not limited to):
- Augusto, Mendling, Vidgof, & Wurm (2022) ‚Äì Extended Prefix Automata
- Visualization: Radial tidy tree with optimizations from Buchheim et al. (2002)
- TODO: add all references
