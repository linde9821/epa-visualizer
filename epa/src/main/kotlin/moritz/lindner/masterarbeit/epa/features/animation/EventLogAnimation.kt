/**
 * Represents a timeline-based animation of an event log, where each [State] is modeled as
 * a [TimedState] and associated with an interval `[from, to)` during which it is considered active.
 *
 * This class supports efficient temporal queries to determine which states are active at any point
 * in time, enabling time-based visualizations or simulations over an entire log (e.g., for animation
 * or replay).
 *
 * @param T The timestamp type (e.g., [Long], [Int], or [java.time.LocalDateTime]), which must be [Comparable].
 * @property identifier A unique label identifying the origin of this animation (e.g., log name or case ID).
 * @property timedStates A list of all recorded [TimedState] intervals across the event log.
 * @property totalAmountOfEvents The total number of [TimedState] entries in the animation.
